# Update-Css-Variable
Update CSS Variables with JavaScript
This project demonstrates how to use JavaScript to update CSS variables, also known as custom properties. CSS variables provide a convenient way to store and reuse values across multiple styles in a stylesheet, and updating them dynamically with JavaScript allows for further customization and dynamic styling on a page.

In this project, I have used JavaScript to change the values of CSS variables in response to user input, resulting in a dynamic and interactive experience for the user. The project showcases the versatility and power of CSS variables and demonstrates how they can be used to build dynamic user interfaces.

If you're interested in learning more about CSS variables and how to use them in your own projects, I encourage you to check out the code and play around with the demo to see how the updates are implemented
